## Books  

#### Rapid Testing [in lib](https://library.polyu.edu.hk/record=b1628925~S6) [in douban](http://book.douban.com/subject/7925700/)  
+ A Waterfall Test Process
  - Requirements Analysis
  - Test Planning
  - Test Design, Implementation, and Debugging
  - System Test
  - Acceptance Test
  - Maintenance
+ The parts and chapters construct a framework of testing.
+ But the whole book focuses on waterfall test process.
+ It would be a good text book, but a little old fashioned.    

#### Testing Computer Software [in lib](https://library.polyu.edu.hk/record=b1549752~S6) [in douban](http://book.douban.com/subject/1440426/)
+ It is full of detailed forms and tips
+ A very practical and useful handbook
+ All the infomation is in pieces. Every page is filled by bullets and forms. Very difficult to read.    

#### Testing Applications on the Web [in lib](https://library.polyu.edu.hk/record=b1718851~S6) [in douban](http://book.douban.com/subject/1788552/) [in iask](http://ishare.iask.sina.com.cn/f/12917021.html)
+ The content is different with other books.
+ It includes Network(TCP and HTTP xml) and Database testing.
+ But it is a little old, the http protocol, the database and the testing script language.

+ Q&As about testing
+ Sensitive and emotional
