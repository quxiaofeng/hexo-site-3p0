The size and outlook of the device is very important. What size is most comfortable for people to use? It is very hard to tell. Here some info about the ergonomics research are collected.

## Ergonomics in Research

**Ergonomics**, as defined by [Human Factors and Ergonomics Society](https://www.hfes.org/Web/default.aspx), is equal to **Human Factors**.

Ergonomics is not not only about the **physiological** (or **physical**) factors.
It consists of two kinds of factors, **physiological (physical) factors** and **psychological factors**.

+ [**Human factors and ergonomics** on WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics)
+ [**Human Factors Psychology** on About.com](http://psychology.about.com/od/branchesofpsycholog1/f/human-factors.htm)

## Professional Ergonomics Groups

+ [Institute of Ergonomics & Human Factors](http://iehf.org/)
+ [香港人类工效学学会](http://www.ergonomics.org.hk/)
+ [International Ergonomics Association (IEA)](http://www.iea.cc/)
+ [Human Factors and Ergonomics Society](https://www.hfes.org/). There are some website errors, so the management of this group could be a chaos.

## Ergonomics Websites

+ [Processforusability.co.uk](http://www.processforusability.co.uk/index.htm)

This website is about human factors.
There is much information about various kinds of human factor fields in this site.
However, this web page itself is not ergonomic nor elegant.
Fractions and pieces of text are everywhere, and distributed in a chaos manner.
It is just a disaster for readers.

+ [Ergonomics of hand held devices for industrial use](http://www.processforusability.co.uk/PIC54webslides/Slides/Ergonomics_of_hand-held_devices.htm)

A website about how to design hand held devices in a ergonomic way.

+ [Ergonomics: A table of anthropometric data](http://www.technologystudent.com/designpro/ergo1.htm)

This site is generally about physical factors of ergonomics， mostly statistical data of human body parts.

+ [Human Touch Sensing for Actuators in Haptic Interfaces](http://www-cdr.stanford.edu/touch/actuators/Actuators_Sensing_Summary.html)

Valuable data about human touch sensing. The methodology and way of reporting are both worth learning.
